# stock_technical_analysis
The **goal** is to create a program that will analyze large sets of stock information for trends

**_PRIMARY TRENDS TO ANALYZE:_**

   **Moving Averages** -- useful for identifying upwards and downwards stock trends over time, the intersections between SMA and MA are useful for this
   **Candlestick Charts** -- may be useful, very helpful for humans because there are visual identifiers _not so sure if it will be useful for a program_
   
_**NEEDS:**_
  1. Access to large amounts of stock data, _**Not Necessary** in **Real Time**_
  2. At least some understanding of how technical analysis is performed without a program.
